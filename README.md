Hi, my name is Nate Lang, and I am about to begin my 3rd year of CS at Northeastern. I am also minoring in economics.
I just finished my first coop, where I worked primarily as a back end web developer using Java EE/Spring, but I got the chance for the last month to work on a full stack web app.
This web app is called request mirror, and it is a tool for developers to use when testing their applications. It takes any HTTP requests, and stores them in database, so that they can be displayed in a very easily digestible, user friendly way.
Users can see the headers, body, time, HTTP protocol, and origin IP of their requests, and the app supports sockets so that there is no need to refresh the page to see the new requests.
I am currently working on getting the app hosted, but the code is complete and containerized at this point.

This repository is for the assignemnts in the web dev course at Northeastern. I have a seperate repo for my project.

The assignments are hosted here: [Assignments host](https://summer2-webdev-assignments.herokuapp.com/)  
The project is hosted here: [Come back later]()
